									<p>First things first, as a user and a TUP faculty, it’s better if during account creation and or login, TUP-related ID information would be used as a username since this project should be exclusively available for TUP students and professors. For the password, a default one should suffice but immediate request for a password change should be implemented as to avoid account misuse issues.

									<p>As a professor, I want a site where I can provide lists of lectures and modules to the students so they can have advance readings about certain topics and we can have a smooth conversation inside the classroom. I also want a part of that website where I can give assignments, quizzes, and examinations so that we are not going to be late in the school calendar.
